{"name":"Ourmods","tagline":"Archiving Minecraft, and it's community","body":"### News\r\nWork has begun on the first version of OurMods. Server configuration is complete, and work on file and database structure are underway! The initial preview will include mods, plugins, and server tools from the Beta days (1.0 — 1.8.1).\r\n\r\n### Scope\r\nThe OurMods Project seeks to preserve the entirety of Minecraft's rich history. Be it mods, plugins, server administration tools, mod loaders, or world modification tools. We do not seek to serve as a \"mod host\", but as a preservation of the content that makes Minecraft so unique.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\nMinecraft, like many modern games, relies on a connection to their company's servers in order to dowload crucial portions of the game files. When these companies eventually decide to shut down these servers, the game is then rendered unplayable and unable to be enjoyed by future generations. By archiving these crucial game files, along with the additional community content that makes Minecraft so unique, this wonderful game will be available to play long after Mojang/Microsoft discontinue it.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* Archive all libraries and resources  (now downloaded at runtime) needed to launch each vesion of Minecraft: Official, Beta, and Alpha, with Infdev, and Indev coming later.\r\n* Keep extensive documentation on mod creation, mod porting (MCPortcentral), plugin creation, and instructions for how to compile each mod/plugin/tool. With all the required tools for creation archived as well (Including MCP, and all mod creation dependencies).\r\n* Archive every single version of Forge, Modloader, ModloaderMP, MinecraftPortCentral(Beta 1.8.1 — 1.2.5), Cauldron Craftbukkit, Spigot. Even jenkins builds, development builds, and experimental builds.\r\n* Collect guides for each version of mods and plugins, including installation and use.\r\n* Offer all files downloads as torrents, or as direct downloads from our file server (with checksum verification).\r\n* Git mirrors: The latest available git respositories for all opened source mods, plugins, and tools. Hosted on our servers in a read-only state, and included in the OurMods Insurance torrents.\r\n* Monthly full-site dumps in torrent format, akin to [WikiLeaks' Insurance File](https://www.facebook.com/wikileaks/posts/561927090509074). If the site ever shuts down, a recent version of the entirety of the site's content (files, guides, even site code) should be avaiable on the web forever, or at least as long as someone is seeding.\r\n* Full featured API - Allowing the community to create Launchers, IRC Bots, or anything else you might come up with.\r\n* Opened source! Shortly after our full launch, the source code of the site will be made available in its entirely, including web front-end and back-end code, SQL database dumps, and anything else that makes OurMods.net tick.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n* Old/Discontinued mods will be obtained by contacting the original developer, searching through old modpack archives, and by community-sourcing via IRC/Reddit.\r\n* Recent mods will be added manually as well, and by scraping existing mod hosting services.\r\n* Contributors will create curated pages and community forums for each mod.\r\n\r\n### Get Involved\r\nIf you'd like to assist in the archival process, please join us on our [IRC Channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=OurMods) #OurMods on irc.esper.net\r\n\r\nWe'd really appreciate help finding legitimate files for mods and plugins that are no longer available due to dead links, thread closings, etc. If you find any such files, we'd love to hear about it on the IRC channel.\r\n\r\nThe following positions are available (and would be greatly appreciated):\r\n* Front-end Web Developers - Create a simple, informative web interface.\r\n* Community Managers - Curate the pages for mods, plugins, and server tools, moderate on the IRC channel.\r\n* Documentation Specialists - Assemble/create helpful guides on installation and use of the mods, plugins, and server administration tools. This position demands an in-depth knowledge of modding early in the history of the game.\r\n\r\nIf you think you can help in some other meaningful way, talk to us on our IRC channel, we're happy to take all the help we can get!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
